<h2 name="feasibility">Step 1: Feasibility</h2>

Who are the survey audiences?

- Who do we know?
- How many survey responses per community, how many communities does that give us? 
- How powered would we be to analyse?
- Have our contacts said yes to our timeframe?

__DECISION:__ ask Lou - are we well-powered enough to run a survey?

<h2 name="design">Step 2: Design</h2>

- Scope the survey questions
- Draft the survey
- Draft the consent form to allow for open publication and sharing (BE CAREFUL WITH PERSONAL DATA)
- Check in with Lou -- is this well-designed?
- Agree the survey
- Publish it

<h2 name="run">Step 3: Run survey</h2>

- Recruit the program managers to run the survey (see step 1)
- Set a timeline
- Prioritise K & Tâ€™s network
- HAVE A CENTRAL PLACE FOR THE RAW DATA
- Publish the raw data (once all surveys done, have a cut-off deadline)
  - Especially return the data back to the program manager
  
<h2 name="analyse">Step 4: Analyse survey data</h2>

- Analyse our own communities first
- Analyse all
- Can we ask the program mgr to analyse their own?
- Cross-cutting insights

<h2 name="communicate">Step 5: Communicate results</h2>

Produce some kind of communication of results.

- External communication (report? Publication? Blog? One-pager? TBD) -- this is prepared by December
- December meeting talk to fellows

<h2 name="case">Step 6/alternative: Case studies</h2>

Explore verticals (depth not breadth) with qualitative interviews. (A nice-to-have or an alternative approach.)

- Which communities?
- Which verticals?
- Scope interview questions
